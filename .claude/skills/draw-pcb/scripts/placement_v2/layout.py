"""Phase C — deterministic region-based layout (no SA, no cost function).

Each region rect from Phase B becomes a grid. Footprints are laid out
in-order on the grid with two pre-arrangement rules:

  • decoupling_pairs [(a, b)]: cap is snapped immediately east of its IC
    so the routed trace is short (declared "place these close").
  • chains [a, b, c, ...]: members occupy consecutive grid cells in the
    declared order.

No cost function, no annealing — the goal is "good-enough zoning", with
final touch-up done by hand in the KiCad GUI. Slot avoidance is handled
at the floorplan level (region rect excludes the slot) plus a runtime
keepout check that skips any grid cell overlapping a keepout rect.
