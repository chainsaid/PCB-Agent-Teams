"""draw-pcb toolbox tool: check_connector_access

The PHYSICAL-USABILITY GATE for interface parts. `check_placement` proves a
placement is *legal* (nothing overlaps, nothing off-board); this tool proves
the board can actually be *plugged into*.

The failure it exists to catch: a connector sitting correctly on the board edge
with its mating opening pointing at the board interior. Nothing else sees it —
DRC is happy, courtyards do not overlap, "hugs the edge" passes, the render
looks fine — and the fabricated board has terminals you cannot land a wire on.
Rotation is the usual culprit (a 180° error is invisible in a bbox), so is a
mating face recessed far enough behind the edge that the plug's overmold hits
the board.

HOW THE MATING DIRECTION IS FOUND (no library metadata exists for this):
on a SIDE-ENTRY connector the solder interface sits away from the mouth, so the
body outline extends further past the pad bbox on the mating side than on any
other. Measure that overhang on each of the four local sides; the winner is the
mating side, and it must win by both an absolute distance and a RATIO over the
runner-up (absolute-only makes confidence track part size, not evidence).

The premise holds only for side-entry parts. A top-entry (+Z) housing walls its
pads in on every side and has no in-plane mating side at all, yet its widest
wall still "wins" — measured against KiCad's own library that mislabelled 26%
of vertical connectors. `looks_vertical()` catches those by name before any
geometry runs. Even for side-entry parts a bounding box cannot see the wire-
entry funnels that actually mark the mouth, so a thin winning ratio is reported
as a `thin_margin` warning rather than passed off as certainty.

Evaluated on every body layer present (CrtYd / Fab / SilkS); layers that
disagree, a near-symmetric body, or a footprint with no body outline at all
yield `undetermined` — a HARD FAIL, not a silent pass, because a guess here
ships a board that cannot be used. Declare those explicitly with --declare.

HARD checks (any one → hard_fail):
  faces_inward   mating direction does not point at the nearest board edge
  not_at_edge    mating face further than --max-gap behind the edge it faces
  blocked        another part sits in the insertion corridor
  undetermined   mating direction not derivable and not declared

Reported as warnings (not the gate):
  overhang       body extends past the board edge by more than --max-overhang
  switch parts   skipped unless declared (most are top-actuated)

Output JSON:
  hard_fail (bool — the gate), connectors[], violations[], warnings[]

Usage:
  check_connector_access.py <board.kicad_pcb> [--declare decl.json]
      [--max-gap MM] [--max-overhang MM] [--include R1,R2] [--exclude R3]

--declare JSON: {"CN8": {"mating_dir": "-Y", "note": "datasheet fig 3"}}
  mating_dir ∈ +X | -X | +Y | -Y | +Z | none
  FOOTPRINT-LOCAL, as drawn in the footprint editor — the same frame as
  placement_brief's `mating_side_local`, NOT a board direction. It states what
  the datasheet says about the part; the tool still rotates it by the placed
  angle and checks where that lands. Declaring a board direction instead would
  answer the question being asked and let a part rotated into the board pass.
  +Z   mates from above (vertical header, mezzanine) — edge rule not applied
  none not an interface part — skip entirely (counted in `silenced[]`)
