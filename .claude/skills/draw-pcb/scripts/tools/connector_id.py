"""draw-pcb toolbox helper: connector / switch identification.

Shared by `placement_brief` (edge_devices) and `check_connector_access` so the
two never disagree about what counts as an interface part.

Why not refdes prefixes alone: a refdes prefix is a *drafting convention*, not
a fact about the part. Boards ported from other EDA tools routinely use CN/DC/
TF/P where the KiCad convention would say J, and a prefix-only rule silently
drops those parts out of every edge-related check — the part is then placed
mid-board and nobody is told. The footprint library id names the physical part
and is the strongest available signal.

Why TOKEN matching and not substring: measured against KiCad's own 7.7k
footprints, raw substring matching is catastrophic in both directions.
`tact` ⊂ `PhoenixContact` swallowed 583 of 709 Phoenix footprints into the
"switch" class — which is exempt from the access gate — so the pluggable HV
terminal blocks an isolation board is built around were silently never
checked. In the other direction `usb` ⊂ `SML-LX0404SIUPGUSB` made an LED a
connector, `ffc` ⊂ `Offcenter` made a WLCSP one, and `socket` pulled in every
DIP socket. Both failure modes come from matching inside words, so the fix is
to match whole tokens.

Classification (a part is an interface part if ANY fires):
  1. footprint library id contains a connector / switch keyword TOKEN (strong)
  2. refdes prefix matches AND the body sticks out past the pads   (weak+geom)
  3. caller passed it in `include`                                 (explicit)
…unless a veto fires first (library family or explicit never-list).
