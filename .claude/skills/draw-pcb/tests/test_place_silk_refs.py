"""Pure geometry of the silk designator placer — candidates and cost order.

The helper module imports pcbnew at module level; a stub satisfies that here
because everything under test is plain rectangle arithmetic. Fixtures are
constructed, not lifted from a layout: replaying a real board proves only
that its numbers were transcribed.
